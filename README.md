- **[Extension](./Extension/)**: This folder contains all the code for developing and deploying a chrome extension

## Contribution

- Please push all the files and code to the `dev` branch.
- Create a merge request to push code from `dev` into `main` branch which will be reviewed.
- Once the code review is done, do the required changes, and merge the request into the `main` branch.
