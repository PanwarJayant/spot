# Extension

This sub-repo contains all the code for developing and deploying a chrome extension.


To run this Chrome extension, follow these steps:

 - Go to chrome://extensions in your Chrome browser.
- Enable "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner of the page.
- Click the "Load unpacked" button.
- Navigate to the folder that contains your extension's files, and select it.

The extension should now be installed and running in your browser. You should see the extension's icon in the browser's toolbar. Clicking on the icon should open the extension's popup window.

You can also package the extension into a .crx file, which can be installed like any other Chrome extension. To do this, follow these steps:

 - Go to chrome://extensions in your Chrome browser.
- Click the "Pack extension" button.
Navigate to the folder that contains your extension's files, and select it.
- Click the "Pack extension" button.

This will create a .crx file in the same directory as your extension's files. You can then drag and drop the .crx file into the chrome://extensions page to install it.
